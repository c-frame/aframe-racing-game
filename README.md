# A-Frame Racing Game

Port of [pmndrs's racing-game](https://github.com/pmndrs/racing-game) (r3f and cannon) rewritten in A-Frame with reusable components.

This port is using ammo.js for the vehicle. The `vehicle-controls` component is a port of the [ammo.js webgl_demo_vehicle three.js example](https://rawcdn.githack.com/kripken/ammo.js/8f8b7187ef74994093318645e5e96b11d982688a/examples/webgl_demo_vehicle/index.html) ([code](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/blob/main/examples/webgl_demo_vehicle/index.html))

The assets of the desert and car come from the original pmndrs's racing-game repo and are CC0 licenced.

This is a work in progress, see [GitHub issues](https://github.com/c-frame/aframe-racing-game/issues)
